# Meeting Cost Calculator helper scripts

This repository includes a set of small helper scripts, written in PHP. These scripts convert CSV files from the [Meeting Cost Calculator data repository]() into JavaScript files included in the [Meeting Cost Calculator website repository](https://github.com/meetingcostcalculator/meeting-cost-calculator-hugo-ca).

## Usage

1. Ensure that [all three Meeting Cost Calculator repositories](https://github.com/meetingcostcalculator) are cloned in the same parent folder.
2. From a terminal window, run `php index.php` to update the JavaScript files using the source data CSV files.
3. Commit the updates to the website repository, and make a new pull request.
